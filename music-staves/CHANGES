Change log of the Gamera MusicStaves Toolkit
============================================

 - MusicStaves_skeleton prints warning "no staves found" only
   when debug > 0 (can still be queried by accessing property linelist)

 - MusicStaves_linetracking can optionally use a different Stafffinder

 - fixed a number of memory leaks

 - fixed potential crashes in staff finder miyao and staff finder dalitz

 - no longer warning on deprecated sets module

Version 1.3.6, Feb 12 2010
--------------------------

 - distutil's "sdist" mechanism now used for source releases

 - adapted to version 3.2.4 of Gamera, which now includes
   the deformation plugins degrade_kanungo and white_speckles.
   The corresponding deformation plugins in the MusicStaves
   have been renamed to resolve the name conflicts and to
   make their difference to the Gamera plugins clear:

    o degrade_kanungo renamed to degrade_kanungo_parallel

    o add_white_speckles renamed to white_speckles_parallel

 - removed the plugins binary_dilation and binary_erosion,
   which are now part of the Gamera core (dilate_with_structure
   and erode_with_structure)

Version 1.3.5, Dec 04 2009
--------------------------

 - curvature deformation works again

Version 1.3.4, Apr 17 2009
--------------------------

 - choosing files from icon context menu now also works on Windows

Version 1.3.3, Mar 09 2009
--------------------------

 - fixed a number of memory leaks related to PyList_Append increasing
   the reference count of the passed item

Version 1.3.2, Feb 29 2008
--------------------------

 - ported to wxPython 2.8

 - fixed a compilation error due to ambiguity of round()

Version 1.3.1, Mar 15 2007
--------------------------

 - ported to gcc 4.1

Version 1.3.0, Feb 27 2007
--------------------------

 - new plugins for creating deformations

 - new plugins for evaluating staff removal error rates
   with respect to different error metrics

 - the deskewing in MusicStaves_rl_fujinaga can now be undone

 - new plugins for computing vector field from onebit images,
   which now make MusicStaves_RoachTatem usable

Version 1.2.0, Nov 11 2005
--------------------------

 - ported to Gamera 3.x

 - keep_tall_skewed_runs() accepts Point list rather than
   y_poslist as input parameter. Behaviour is now according
   specification, ie. runs are kept according to their
   height instead of their length

 - CD: new class MusicStaves_skeleton

 - CD: new plugins in skeleton_utilities for skeletons

 - CD: new staff finding algorithms stafffinder_projections
       and stafffinder_dalitz

Version 1.1.1, Jun 03 2005
--------------------------

 - CD: support for argument dialog in remove_staves and find_staves
       fixed some segmentation faults and other problems in 
       staffinder_miyao

Version 1.1.0, May 25 2005
--------------------------

 - CD: StaffFinder_miyao implements a method by H. Miyao
       for staff line finding without removal

 - CD: new base class StaffFinder for finding staff lines
       without removing them. Also provides classes for
       storing line position information (Staffline* classes)

Version 1.0.1, Feb 11 2005
--------------------------

 - replaced filter_*_runs with filter_*_black_runs to be
   compatible with new Gamera plugins


Version 1.0.0, Jan 28 2005
--------------------------

 - TK: o new plugin function keep_tall_skewed_runs()
       o set default value of function 'remove_staves' to 'all'
         (when called from the icon)
 
 - CD: added parameter staffrect to StaffObj

 - MGD: Added the Fujinaga staff removal algorithm.  (In a working
	state, but "number of staff line detection" and different
	kinds of staff removal are not implemented yet.)

 - MGD: Importing MusicStaves no longer imports wxPython unless
	the Gamera GUI is running.  This saves a lot on resources
	and also makes debugging in tools such as gdb and vlagrind
	much easier.

 - CD: MusicStaves also constructable from greyscale image

 - CD: new plugin function correct_rotation()


Version 0.5.0, Dec 22 2004
--------------------------

 - first release with one algorithm "MusicStaves_rl_simple"
