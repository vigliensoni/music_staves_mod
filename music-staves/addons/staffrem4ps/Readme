Readme for staffrem4ps
======================

Purpose
-------

staffrem4ps.py is a python script for removing staff lines from
scores in postscript format. It supports a variety of music 
typesetting programs plus some generic postscript creators
(like Ghostscript's pdf2ps or Adobe's acroread -toPostScript).

Note that the score must be in vector postscript format, not
bitmapped.


Usage
-----

Basic usage is

    staffrem4ps.py score.ps

This will try to guess the creator of the PS file and remove
the staff lines (or what staffrem4ps believes to be staff lines).
The output is written to score-nostaff.ps.

When staffrem4ps cannot guess the creator or guesses wrong,
you can specify the creator explicitly with the option -c.

    staffrem4ps.py -?    prints a help message
    staffrem4ps.py -h    prints all supported creators
