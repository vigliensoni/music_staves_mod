Readme for ps2png
=================

Purpose
-------

ps2png.sh is a Bourne shell script for converting a postscript
file to a bitmap image in PNG format.


Requirements
------------

ps2png relies on ghostscript (executable name: gs) for doing
the actual conversion. On Linux it should come with the OS,
for MacOS X it is -among other options- available through 
Fink (http://fink.sourceforge.net/). The ghostscript source 
code is available from http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/.

As ghostscript converts landscape PS files to portrait,
ps2png tries to detect landscape files and rotates them
after the conversion. There are two ways suppported how this
can be done:

 - with gamera's rotate plugin

 - with the command line program "convert" that is
   part of the ImageMagick suite (http://www.imagemagick.org/)

Which method is used depends on the variable USEIMAGEMAGICK4ROTATION
defined at the top of ps2png. The default is to use gamera, which
is considerably faster because convert does not realize that a
rotation by 90 degrees does not require interpolation.


Installation and Usage
----------------------

For an installation simply move the script to a directory
in your search path and optionally rename it to ps2png, eg.
with

	sudo install -m 755 ps2png.sh /usr/local/bin/ps2png

Basic usage is

    ps2png bla.ps

This will create 'bla.png'. For a list of all options
call ps2png without arguments. Note that you explicitly must
give the option '-eps' if you want an EPS bounding box be
respected.
